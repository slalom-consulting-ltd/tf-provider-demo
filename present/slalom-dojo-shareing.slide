* What is it

- Terrafom lets you define your infrastructure as code. Under the hood it's a powerful state machine that makes API requests and marshals resources.

- A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Most providers configure a specific infrastructure platform (either cloud or self-hosted). Providers can also offer local utilities for tasks like generating random numbers for unique resource names.

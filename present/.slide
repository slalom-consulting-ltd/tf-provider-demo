* Terraform and Terraform provider

- Terrafom is a powerful state machine that makes API requests and marshals resources.

- A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Most providers configure a specific infrastructure platform (either cloud or self-hosted). Providers can also offer local utilities for tasks like generating random numbers for unique resource names.

💡 Why not build a custom provider to handle your tags?

: presenter note
: tagging cloud resources is always a good idea and can be quite important. The question will be how can we make the process easier?

* Prerequisites

To build a custom terraform provider to tag your cloud resources, we will need an API first. 

    $ curl -s \
    > -H "Authorization: Bearer my_api_tok" \
    > https://30cqdcgkq7.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/tag?team=abc \
    > | jq .
    {
    "msg": "👍Yep! it is the right api key",
    "tags": [
        {
        "hostname": "📛 hostname",
        "meta": "📝 Blablablablabla, blabla bla blablablabla blabla blablablablablabla",
        "owner": "🐻 owner",
        "tag": "abc",
        "region": "📍 home",
        "id": "1",
        "name": "🗿"
        }
    ]
    }
